# Southwest Airlines Beverage Planner AI Agent

An AI-driven solution for optimizing beverage inventory on commercial flights, using real-time flight data and historical consumption patterns.

## Overview

This research project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can transform airline beverage planning through precise, flight-specific predictions. Using Southwest Airlines as a case study, we combine real-time flight data with historical consumption patterns to optimize beverage loads for individual flights.
